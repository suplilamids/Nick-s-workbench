📝 Projects:

· CURRENCY EXCHANGER:
    
   [It is made using simple C# code that exchanges EUR to GBP and/or GPB to EUR.]

   LINK to the C# program: https://github.com/suplilamids/Nick-s-workbench/blob/main/Program.cs

<br>
<br>

   It's made for exchanging € and £, but honestly, I could upgrade it even further to exchange any currency, including Cryptocurrency or anything else. 
   The only thing I need to know is the exchange rate between the two currencies, and I'm good to go.


   Also, you could upgrade this program to convert the: 

         ·metric system (kilometers, liters, grams, Celsius) into
         
         ·Imperial System (feet, inches, pounds, stones, and Fahrenheit) or even into
         
         ·United States Customary System (very similar to the Imperial System but with some unique definitions, e.g., US gallon ≠ UK gallon).
